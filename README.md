‚úçÔ∏è Sometimes I [blog](https://rickysquid.org). Lately I've been working through [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) and learning some [Networking Things](https://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/eighth.htm).

üìñ Recently I'm reading [*The English and Their History*](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/17/the-english-and-their-history-review-robert-tombs-resounding-importance) by Robert Tombs. Before that was *True Grit* by Charles Portis. 

‚öΩ My favorite sports teams are Everton FC, Denver Nuggets, Seattle Seahawks, Seattle Mariners.
